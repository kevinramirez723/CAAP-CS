# Horror Text Adventure Game - SERRATED

* **Built from scratch so the use of modules and classes is quite crude.**

* **In doing so I only used Game.py, Scene.py, and Death.py.**

* **Main Game and scenes are fully operational with no bugs that I could see, but does not include a difficulty, checkpoint or leaderboard system.**

* **Exe file also does not work. Running the game through the command prompt with game.py works without any issues.**
