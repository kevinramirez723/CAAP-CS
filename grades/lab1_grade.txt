Comments:
- Very neat code!
- Consider validating ALL of your pages if you will have more than the required.
- The site doesn't look very good in smaller screens. Consider changing the styles for such devices
- some of you links are incorrect because they are not relative to the docs directory, git will ignore this and they will work there, but anywhere else, like in my computer they links are broken.
    --> e.g./CAAP-CS/styles/style.css should be /styles/style.css
